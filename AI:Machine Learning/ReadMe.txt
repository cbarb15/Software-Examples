Here I have provided some code examples for some AI and Machine Learning algorithms that I implmented. All of this code was a part of a larger program that ran a pacman game. It was through this pacman game that we implemeted the different algorithms and watched pacman's success or failure in different ways. 

In the valueIterations.py file the code that I wrote was

  code in the init() function
  the computeQValueFromValues() function
  the computeActionFromValues() function
  and getAction function

  In the qLearningAgent.py file in the QLearningAgent class I wrote

  code in the init() function
  the getQValue() funciton
  the computeValueFromQValues() function
  the computeActionFromQValues() funcrion
  the getAction() function
  the update() function

 In the qLearningAgent.py file in the ApproximateQAgent class I wrote

 the getQValue() funciton
 the update() function


 In the busterAgents.py file in the GreedyBustersAgent class I wrote

 the chooseAction function

 In the inference.py file in the ExactInference class I wrote

 the observe() function
 the elapseTime() function

 In the inference.py file in the ParticleFilter class I wrote

 the initializeUniformly() function
 the observe() function
 the elapseTime() function
 the getBeliefDistribution() function


 In the inference.py in the JointParticleFilter class I wrote

 the initializeParticles() function
 the observeState() function
 the elapseTime() function
 the getBeliefDistribution() function
